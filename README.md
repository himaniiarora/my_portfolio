My Portfolio Website

This project is my personal portfolio website created as part of the Tailwind CSS Bootcamp.

It includes the following sections:
1. Home – with my name, title, a typing effect, and resume button.
2. About Me – a short introduction, my skills, and education timeline.
3. Projects – showcasing three projects with titles, descriptions, and images.
4. Contact – a form with fields for name, email, and message, along with social media icons.

I built this using only HTML and Tailwind CSS. The design is fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

This project helped me understand how to build real-world websites using utility-first CSS, improve my frontend skills, and structure HTML properly.
